Explanation:
Private Constructor: The constructor is private to prevent instantiation from outside the class.

Static Instance Variable: The static variable instance holds the single instance of DatabaseConnection.

Synchronized Method: The getInstance() method checks if an instance already exists. If not, it creates one. The method is synchronized to make it thread-safe.

Connection Initialization: The connection to the MySQL database is established in the constructor using DriverManager.

Usage: In the SingletonPatternExample, we retrieve the database connection through the singleton instance and can use it for database operations.
