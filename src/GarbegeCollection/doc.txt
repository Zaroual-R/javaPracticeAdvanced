                                      GARBEGE COLLECTION
1- any object on the heap wich can not be reached through a reference  from the stack is eligible from
   garbege collection

2-if we want to call garbeg collection : System.gc() but it is no effecient to call gc exept some cases

3-once, an object is eligible for carbege collection jvm will execute the finalize methode of this object
  and that will be useful for data warning messages
