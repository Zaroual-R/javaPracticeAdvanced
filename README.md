Project README: Advanced Computer Science Concepts in Java

Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Java-based application designed to demonstrate solutions to common problems in computer science, integrating multiple design patterns, advanced data structures, memory management, and multithreading techniques. The aim is to provide a hands-on exploration of complex concepts often encountered by software engineers.

Key Features

Design Patterns: Implementation of commonly used design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Builder to address various software engineering challenges.

Escaping References: Solutions to avoid memory leaks by preventing references from being improperly exposed in collections and class structures.

Data Structures: Utilization of advanced data structures, including custom tree structures (e.g., binary search trees and AVL trees) to optimize search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Garbage Collection: Explanation and simulation of Javaâ€™s garbage collection mechanisms and strategies for improving memory management.

Multithreading: Demonstration of concurrent programming using Java's multithreading features, including Thread, Runnable, and the Executor framework to handle tasks efficiently.

Tree Operations: Implementing tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order) and strategies to maintain tree balance.
